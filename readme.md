## 📦 Install via NPM (Requires Bun)

If you have [Bun installed](https://bun.sh/), you can run it directly:

```bash
# Run one-off
bunx zombie-dev-watcher

# Install globally
npm install -g zombie-dev-watcher
zombie-watcher
```

## Description

The tool operates in two modes:

1. **Port Mode** (Default): Watches target ports (e.g., `5173`). When a new process starts on a higher port in the range, the watcher automatically kills the old process to free up resources.
2. **Process Mode** (`--mode process`): Watches for **duplicate processes** based on their command line arguments. If you launch the same script/command again, the old instance is killed. It also supports killing processes that run for too long.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.
- **Auto-Kill Zombies**: Prevents "marching ports" (5173 -> 5174 -> 5175...) by killing the old process when a new one appears.
- **Process Deduplication**: Kills older instances of the exact same command line to prevent duplicates.
- **Max Age Timeout**: Automatically kill processes that have been running for too long (e.g., > 30 mins).
- **Singleton / Multi-Instance**: 
    - Binds to port **322** to ensure usage as a singleton for a specific set of watched ports.
    - If 322 is taken, it automatically tries **323, 324... up to 332**, allowing you to run multiple independent watchers for different projects.

## Usage

### 1. Port Watcher (Default)

Matches processes by **port usage**.

```bash
# Run with default settings (Base: 5173, Lock Port: 322)
./zombie-watcher.exe

# Watch multiple ports (e.g., Vite and a backend API)
zombie-watcher --base "5173,3000,8080"
```

### 2. Process Watcher (New)

Matches processes by **exact command line**. Useful for scripts that don't bind ports or when you want to ensure only one instance of a specific task runs.

```bash
# Watch for duplicate node/bun processes and kill the old ones
zombie-watcher --mode process --filter "node;bun"

# Kill any node process that runs longer than 30 minutes
zombie-watcher --mode process --max-age 30
```

### Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-m, --mode` | Watch mode: `port` or `process` | `port` |
| `-b, --base` | Base ports to watch (Port Mode) | `5173` |
| `-r, --range` | Port range to scan | `20` |
| `-f, --filter` | Filter process names (semicolon separated) | `bun;node;npm;...` |
| `--max-age` | Kill processes older than N minutes (Process Mode) | `0` (Disabled) |
| `-d, --dry-run` | Log what would be killed without killing | `false` |
